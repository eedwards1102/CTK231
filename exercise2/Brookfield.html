<h2> Take a look At The Brookfield Poster</h2>
<p> Based on the image description I have, this poster depicts the Brookfield Zoo and a panther. Brookfield is a neat place. You should visit if you are in Chicago.</p>
<img src="Zoo.gif" alt="A Federal Art Project poster for the Brookfield Zoo. The image features a stylized black panther with bright green eyes and a snarling red mouth, crouched as if ready to pounce. The word 'BROOKFIELD' is in large red letters above the panther, and 'ZOO' is below it.">
