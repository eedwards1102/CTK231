<p> “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.” (Steve Jobs.)</p>
<h2>Poster Image</h2>
<img src="Posters.png" alt="A WPA-style poster for an 'Exhibition of Posters'. The image features a highly stylized, geometric man in black and white, sitting against a solid blue background. He holds a large white sign with the words 'EXHIBITION OF POSTERS' in blue and black text. Below him, text in a brown Art Deco font reads 'FEDERAL ART PROJECT, WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION'.">
<p> I am unable to see the image, but based on the Gemini provided alt text, it looks like some sort of exhibition with a poster.</p>
